reference test for strongswan-strongswan interop with EAP

This currently fails on timeout of crl/ocsp fetching. And throws
some non-utf8 to the console. Disabling of crl/ocsp which is not
used in this test can only be done by changing strongswan.conf
to explicitely load all default modules except "revocation". This
would break things when new modules are added :/
